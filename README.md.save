 JackWorkspace

We are going to try to get some openMP code running for Jack.

We are working off of the web site: 
https://www.dartmouth.edu/~rc/classes/intro_openmp/hello_world_openmp.html

We are going to do the hello world comments first.

We use nano then the file name to open and close the text documents.

Crtl x in nano will close a file.

You have to right click to paste in code.

We made a file called Hello_OpenMP.c and now we pasted the code in and we run it.


We use the commands gcc -fopenmp Hello_OpenMP.c -lm -o test
This command make the executable called test.

Then we use the command 
mv test.out hello 
to rename the file from test to hello
